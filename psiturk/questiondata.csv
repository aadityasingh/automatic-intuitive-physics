A35RHTBO93Y2HF:3EFVCAY5L585UKHG8K4K7D9GXU5J8B,strategies,yes - sound and ground surface did not match sometimes.
A35RHTBO93Y2HF:3EFVCAY5L585UKHG8K4K7D9GXU5J8B,notice,I don't know. (Don't ask this question.)

BLUBIRD:BLUBIRD,strategies,The sounds did not match for some of the trials.
BLUBIRD:BLUBIRD,notice,"Yes, but not after seeing the anomalous trials. "

FOR4EVER:FOR4EVER,strategies,Images and sounds didn't always match up. You might see a ceramic place and hear a very soft sound.
FOR4EVER:FOR4EVER,notice,Somewhat? Was moving through the trials a little too fast for it to really make a difference.

FOR4EVER:FOR4EVER,comments,"I hope you do some kind of clustering analysis. I kinda set some arbitrary points for loudness levels but didn't necessarily remember them exactly, so some of the variance in a loudness cluster might be from not remembering the exact spots."
lalala:lalala,strategies,Not really -- to be honest I kind of zoned out and just paid attention to sounds
lalala:lalala,notice,"Yes, based on the material of the surface"

lalala:lalala,comments,"Because of bad calibration early on, I only really ranged from very soft to medium sounds"
ekx888:ekx888,strategies,not really? except sometimes the sound didn't match the surface sometimes
ekx888:ekx888,notice,no because i had more fun trying to identify the sound than recognizing the surface

HELLO:HELLO,strategies,"there were times when there were two sounds of impact and other times when there were three sounds of impact. it seemed like it was because of the shape of the object. also not sure if I saw wrong, but there were times when the material didn't match the expected sound?"
HELLO:HELLO,notice,"yeah like the foam would be quiet, wood would be medium, and ceramic would be loud."
